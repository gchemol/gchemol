# Features

-   Fast and safe codes empowered by Rust.
-   Static build without external dependencies: easy to deploy in HPC environment.
-   Core graph data structure using [petgraph](https://github.com/bluss/petgraph)
-   Read/write molecules in [common chemcial file formats](https://github.com/gchemol/gchemol-readwrite/tree/master/src/formats).
-   Linear algebra backed by [nalgebra](http://nalgebra.org/)
-   Render molecule in user defined formats by templating with [handlebars](https://github.com/sunng87/handlebars-rust) and [tera](https://tera.netlify.com/docs)
